Association of COVID-19 symptoms, cardiopulmonary abnormalities, health self-perception, resilience, fatigue and stress scoring at the 1-year follow-up (__Supplementary Tables S1__ and __S2__) was investigated by pairwise Kendall's $\tau$ correlation test.

Clustering of the study participants in respect to `r length(globals$clust_variables)` binary symptom, cardiopulmonary and psychosocial features recorded at the 1-year follow-up (__Supplementary Table S1__ and __S2__) was investigated by the PAM algorithm (PAM: partitioning around medoids, simple matching distance).

__(B)__ Differences in frequency of the clustering variables between the recovery clusters were investigated by $\chi^2$. P values were corrected for multiple testing with the Benjamini-Hochberg method. Lines represent the estimated percentages of the feature in the cluster, tinted regions represent 2$\times$SEM intervals. Features significantly differing between the clusters are labeled in bold.
